Home automation System

## What is Homematic?
Homematic is a home automation system that allows the user to integrate their home electronic systems seamlessly with the Homematic control interface.

## Features
- Uses arduino in the background to interface with the electronics. This ensures a minimal modification of the existing electrical system including installation of new wiring systems and new electrical fittings.
- Intuitive control interface which ensures a very user-friendly user experience and a small learning curve while learning to use the control interface.
- With arduino add-on packages the user can add additional functionalities to the main system (like monitoring temperature, humidity, etc) with almost no significant effort.
